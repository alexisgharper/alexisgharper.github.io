    <p>I started a Wikihow tutorial called “How to save a document”. I learned that in most if not all documents that you create, there’s a save button that saves to either your personal or business files. This allows you to access your documents on more than one computer and could allow more than one person to access the same document from anywhere. For my first step of the tutorial I clicked on “File” on the top left side of my window tab and pressed on  “Save as”. I then selected a location for my document For Example “My Documents”. I renamed my document file to any name I wanted to. The name I chose was “Research Summaries” as I'm using the doc for my summary reports. I finally clicked save and it was now saved to my Docs. Just like that I learned how to save my documents and files. I Believe that the tutorial is very useful for everyday life as a graphic designer especially and for someone who just works on the web all the time. I use this technique every time I have work that I can't complete at the moment. I save the document/file/etc and come back to it whenever I have the time. This is very useful as a graphic designer especially as documents and files are all we use. It's also a great way to share things with others as you could save the Document/file/etc to a shared folder for other people to view. If someone were to not know how to do this, it would make things challenging  as you would have to recreate everything over and over again because nothing was saved. The research and experimentation that brought us to now saving things this easily on a device fascinates me how far we came, from floppy disks to usb to now just pressing a save button.</p>
