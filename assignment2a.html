    <p>I began to read the activity for session 2a called “GCFLearnFree: Internet Tips”. I learned and understood the tips given to me and learned how to use them for my everyday life. I chose the link on “understanding hyperlinks”. I understood that hyperlinks have an important role in the web wherever you go. There will always be hyperlinks in any and or every device you use that uses the web. It doesn't matter if you’re on a computer, a laptop, a phone, or watching something on a smart tv, there will be hyperlinks in any web browser you use and in any web page you go to. Hyperlinks are a way to just click on what you want to see, learn, or know more about and get sent straight into it instead of having to search for it for hours. I also clicked on “How to clear your web browsers cache”. Which helped me understand that cache is just temporary files in websites that help speed things up like loading into the page or extra information for future visits. It's good to clear your cache once in a while because cache tends to get old and display outdated information or give errors. Out of Those two things I talked about they both seem the most important to me as I plan to pursue Web Design as a graphic designer and knowing that hyperlinks and cache can have a great impact on how the website will look and interact with the user that's looking into my website. Understanding the reasons for cache and the reasons for having to clear cache is good because it allows me to not get any outdated information or errors when previewing live or web based prototypes of imagery. Incorporating these practices into my daily routine of graphic design will help maintain the quality and functionality of my design work and will ensure that my creations are presented accurately and effectively.</p>
 <p>I began reading one of the activities called “TutorialsPoint: Web Browsers”. I read and understood that in a summarized version, there are many different types of web browsers and they all function differently in their own ways. Browsers back then used to only be text based with little to no imagination, or functions to do. Web browsers in the present now show more than text, they present things like Images, audio, video, and even animation. The web browser's responsibilities are to interpret text and commands given by its user in a web page. Modern browsers offer ranges to better a users experience such as bookmarks, tabbed browsing, and extensions. They also offer things like sandboxing, incognito mode, and tracking prevention to help users to protect themselves and insure security. It also helps users to control their personal data and browsing habits. A browser's primary function is to translate things such as HTML, JavaScript code from web servers, and CSS. browsers also handle protocols like HTTP and HTTPS to ensure data transfer to be secure and effecient. Understanding web browsers involves understanding and recognizing their huge role in how we interact with online content and engage with digital media. As technology advances in the future, so are browsers. I think that understanding the fundamentals and recognizing the importance of web browsers will help me with my future career as a graphic designer. Although both do not really correlate together, understanding and knowing the difference between web browsers will help as web pages show differently in different web browsers. It will also help me understand how it would not only be viewed in things like laptops and computers but also in things like phones, and televisons. Furthermore, I think understanding web browsers is a great thing to learn when working on the web.
