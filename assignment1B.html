    <p>I started a WikiHow tutorial called “How to save a document”. I learned that in most if not all documents that you create, there’s a save button that saves to either your personal or business files. This allows you to access your documents on more than one computer and could allow more than one person to access the same document from anywhere. For my first step of the tutorial I clicked on “File” on the top left side of my window tab and pressed on  “Save as”. I then selected a location for my document For Example “My Documents”. I renamed my document file to any name I wanted to. The name I chose was “Research Summaries” as I'm using the doc for my summary reports. I finally clicked save and it was now saved to my Docs. Just like that I learned how to save my documents and files. I Believe that the tutorial is very useful for everyday life as a graphic designer especially and for someone who just works on the web all the time. I use this technique every time I have work that I can't complete at the moment. I save the document/file/etc and come back to it whenever I have the time. This is very useful as a graphic designer especially as documents and files are all we use. It's also a great way to share things with others as you could save the Document/file/etc to a shared folder for other people to view. If someone were to not know how to do this, it would make things challenging  as you would have to recreate everything over and over again because nothing was saved. The research and experimentation that brought us to now saving things this easily on a device fascinates me how far we came, from floppy disks to usb to now just pressing a save button.</p>
    <p>I read, visualized, and have done the WikiHow tutorial for “How to organize an electronic filing system”. I started with choosing which files I wanted organized. In the tutorial it was mentioned that I could use the shift button to choose more than one file all at once. After choosing which files I wanted organized and moved, I chose where to move them to. I chose to make a new folder for my files to organize them better. After having all my files in the folder I made “sub folders” which are just oither folders in a folder. I then chose to back them up in case my computer were to somehow crash in the future or have my files corrupted. I learned that file organization is very necessary, important, and very reliable when it comes to working on the internet. Not only does it make your file explorer look cleaner but it also makes it easier for you to find what you are looking for. Instead of looking around and wasting hours of time for one file, organizing the files will not only save you a lot of time. I think that this is very beneficial and important to do as I am going towards more of a graphic design based career. I'll have to work with many files and remember where I put them so it would for sure help me out in the long run and save me lots of time. Organization is very important in this workforce since you need to confidently know where you left your files. If we were to not have this level of organization, it would be like walking into a maze to find the document/file you are trying to find. In the long run, it would be better to know where your files are at. Not only for you but for your client for example or for your contributors.</p>
